I'm interested to make big scale applications, which is fast, built on clean code, also looks clean so users don't get scared or confused with the UI. I'm a teenager and I'm preparing myself to make something exceptional **to help the world!** Not all of my projects will be released to Github, until they become useful enough to make them public.

Skills: C / C++(LEARNING) / PYTHON(LEARNING) / RUST(LEARNING)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
