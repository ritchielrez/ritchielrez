### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ritchiel Reza
#### I am a self taught programmer, who loves to solve problems with the help of programming
![I am a self taught programmer, who likes **C++** and **Rust**!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cd/85/8e/cd858e9f725e9848777c04c57b79c68e.jpg)

I'm interested to make big scale performant applications. I'm a teenager and programming is one of my favourite hobbies. 
Thus most of my projects are hobby projects meaning I don't work on them fulltime. But I am interested to work as a
programmer or server administrator in the future. Scroll down below this page to check out some projects that I have worked
on and I am proud about.

**Programming languages that I know the basics of:**
- C
- C++
- Golang

**Sofwares that I use:**
- Firefox (my preferred web browser)
- Windows/Linux (I like to hop between these two operating systems often)
- Neovim/Vscode (Both are fine but I like neovim more)
- Visual Studio (The only IDE that I like to use)
- Alacritty (An amazing terminal emulator which works on all major platforms)
